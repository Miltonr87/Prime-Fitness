### About

Made most in SPA style with Vanilla JS and Bootstrap (contact form). Prime Fitness is a professional-level site that I build to train tips in Advanced CSS (Grid and Flexbox). Prime Fitness has an interesting smooth scroll control (top to bottom) and a "Personal BMI Calculator" made from scratch in Vanilla JS taken from my another project. You can visit the other repository here [Personal BMI Calculator](https://github.com/Miltonr87/Personal-BMI-Calculator).
